# Healthchecks.io Status Dashboard

A standalone dashboard page showing the status of the checks in your [Healthchecks.io](https://healthchecks.io)
account.

[See a live example dashboard here](https://cuu508.github.io/).

* Single page, no external dependencies.
* Plain HTML, JS and CSS. Fork it and hack on it â€“ no build tools or dev environment needed.
* Live-updates every 5 seconds.
* Can display checks from multiple projects.
* Uses Healthchecks.io read-only API keys, does not expose ping URLs.

## Light Theme

## How To Use

* Fork the repository.
* Edit `index.html` and replace the API keys in `<h1>` tags. Be sure to use the
**read-only** API keys!
* Optionally, you can tweak the colors, font sizes and layout.
* Publish the `index.html` file to a web server (Github pages, S3 bucket,
Netlify, ...), or simply open it as a local file in your browser.

## Specifying API Keys in the URLsssss

As an alternative to editing `index.html`, the projects and their API keys can be
specified in the URL. Put them in the fragment identifier (after the "#" character) as
amperstand-delimited "apikey=title" pairs. Example:

	index.html#UKsc30GIblRMKKN4BEPXcBNLa8bx4grU=Monitoring&uKatH7z6dSuN2Zyf1luRCmPDkw3fw2U0=Demo

The light theme is used by default, but the dark theme can also be specified
via the URL:


	index.html#theme=dark


## Security

If you decide to make your dashboard public, your read-only API key will
become public as well. Using the read-only API key, anybody can fetch basic information
about checks in your project. This includes, for each check:

* name, **tags and description** (even though tags and descriptions are currently not
being shown on the dashboard)
* check's schedule (period, grace time, cron expression + timezone)
* current status (new / up / down / paused)
* precise time of the last ping
* precise time of when the next ping is expected
* total number of pings the check has received

Here are the things that the read-only API keys *cannot* do:

* the ping URLs are not exposed. You are not risking unexpected pings from random visitors
* no write access: cannot update or delete the existing checks, cannot create new checks
in your project


## Docker image

There is an official [Healthchecks.io Status Dashboard Docker image](https://hub.docker.com/r/healthchecks/dashboard) on Docker Hub ready to use. The image is [automatically built](https://docs.docker.com/docker-hub/builds/) on each commit.

The image starts a lightweight [Caddy Webserver](https://caddyserver.com/) with the dashboard at the webserver's root.
The example below starts a one-off, intercative container serving on port 8080 (`CTRL+C` to stop it):
```
$ docker run --rm -it -p 8080:2015 healthchecks/dashboard
```
